# Ignite - #4 challenge

### Rocketseat's bootcamp fourth challenge. <br />
In this challenge we started off with a restaurant's application entirely made with React class components. <br />
The task was to refactor the entire code into functional components using hooks and add Typescript to the application. üõ¥<br />
<br />
Best way to learn a concept is to get your hands dirty, refactoring an entire code really sticks to your mind.


## :satellite: How to run project
Clone the project and access the folder

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnMaroe/desafio04-ignite-refactoring.git && cd desafio04-ignite-refactoring
